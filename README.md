## What is this?

A project I built using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg)

I wanted to make a "proper tutorial for the T3 Stack" and this is as close as I could get.

Hope it's helpful!

## What do I deploy it on?

- Clerk [https://clerk.com/?utm_campaign=theo-dtc](https://clerk.com/?utm_campaign=theo-dtc)
- Planetscale [https://planetscale.com/?ref=theo](https://planetscale.com/?ref=theo)
- Upstash [https://upstash.com/?utm_source=theo_qstash](https://upstash.com/?utm_source=theo_qstash)
- Vercel [https://vercel.com/?ref=theo](https://vercel.com/?ref=theo)
- Axiom [https://www.axiom.co/?ref=theo](https://www.axiom.co/?ref=theo)

Todo:

- Admin page
- improve profile generation/bio generation (either better prompts or more input boxes, also save some hidden data in the background for image generation
  )
